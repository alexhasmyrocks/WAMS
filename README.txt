Starting WAMS

Run WAMS.exe


Error on the filemaker

If you encounter an error on the filemaker program ignore it and try clicking the submit button again.


Delete Feature:

In the script editor do not delete something if you are at 2 lines. This for some reason creates blank lines and will un sync the delete program to the script reader. Or a solution to this is to open up the commandlog folder, look for the text file that shares the name of your file + log.txt and start it. Now delete any blank lines. Be careful not to delete anything else.

DO NOT DELETE FILES:
Certain files within the WAMS directory should not be deleted or tampered with. These files include anything except the files in the outputs folder where your programs are stored(I would suggest only deleting files through the filemaker). Moving your file from the outputs folder is fine, just don't move it to any of the other folders in the WAMS directory; However, if you do delete a file, just re-download WAMS. Or if you can put the file back in its correct place.

WAMS.exe Startup Error:
If you get an error when starting WAMS, it is most likely because of an error with the icon. If this is the case move proico.ico to the icon folder. Now try starting it.
