What is WAMS:
WAMS stands for, Windows Automated, Maker, Script. This means that 
you can use this program to write windows based batch scripts. You could make
windows based viruses, malware, tools, or games. WAMS allows you to make these 
previously mentioned scripts without almost any pre-existing knowledge of programming;
however, WAMS is currently in Alpha. 
WAMS will be fully released by June 2020.


How to Declare Variables/Keys:

Keys and variables are the same thing; Keys and variables are words or phrases that stand for a value such as an
integer, string, or a float. Variables can be declared within the properties tab in the tool bar. The second console,
to the right of the main log, is the variable console. This console tells you the variables you currently have declared
and their values. To access your variables, use -(the name of your variable); this will replace the - and the name of your
variable with the value of your variable.

Background Programs:
What are they?
Background programs are pre-existing batch scripts that run within your program. There are
two methods of running background programs in WAMS, the first way is where you have the
absolute path. This kind of path is when you have the entire path of the file; this kind of path
will allow the file to only work in the specific location described by the path. The second way
to declare a background program is using a relative path. To use a relative path, add -n to the end
of the name of the batch script you are attempting to run as a background program. This allows 
the program to be run from any drive on the computer, as long as the file is the same directory as 
the batch script calling the background program.

What is a Package?

A package is pre-written code. This can be used to accomplish tasks that may not be accomplishable otherwise.
Packages have no file extension. All you have to do to add the package to your program is add the file to the packages
folder. Next restart WAMS. Now check under the packages tab.

The Future of Packages:

Upcoming updates should allow for the creation and deletion of packages in the code;
however, currently I am encountering problems with it.

When is it ok to move my script?
You can move your file outside of the outputs folder when ever you are not editing it.
Once your script leaves the output folder WAMS cannot make changes to it.
Do not edit any of the other files in the other folders, as those can lead to an error.
